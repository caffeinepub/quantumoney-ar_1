  "summary": "Diff implements a new PageShell/Container/Typography system and applies a dark-luxury theme across many pages/components (Header/Footer, Wallet/Swap, AR/Map/Profile/Rules, Docs/Landing). However, the diff also appears to introduce multiple non-requested product/features (DAO backend-style interactions, gamification/social sharing/XP, new bottom navigation) and may not apply the global PageShell offset consistently to all routed pages (notably HomePage).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All routed pages should render their first meaningful content below the fixed header using a single consistent site-wide approach (shared page wrapper/page shell).",
      "reason": "A PageShell with pt-20 is added and used in many pages, but HomePage.tsx (a critical routed page) does not show use of PageShell/Container and still uses a full-screen section with absolute-positioned elements, so the global/top-offset approach is not evidenced as applied site-wide to all routes.",

    {
      "description": "DAO governance functionality with creating proposals, listing proposals, voting system, real-time updates/auth checks (i.e., new/expanded product capability rather than purely visual/layout changes).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to frontend-only visual/layout changes and forbids new functionality changes; the diff summary states DAO now has full backend integration-style behavior.",

    {
      "description": "Gamification/social sharing flows with +1 XP reward notifications in Plant/Rescue confirmation modals.",

      "description": "New fixed BottomNav with 7 tabs and translated labels / corrected route path.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals include not changing routing structure or adding new navigation items; adding a new bottom navigation bar with multiple tabs is a navigation/IA change.",

    {
      "description": "New/expanded Tutorial page content and accordion instructions (login/bonus, energy/levels/XP, planting/rescuing rules, legal warnings, etc.).",
