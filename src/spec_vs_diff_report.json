  "summary": "The diff implements most of the QMY Token page visual changes (coin image path, glass/yellow card styling) via QMYTokenPage.tsx plus new CSS utilities, but it also includes out-of-scope changes (notably backend/main.mo) and provides no clear evidence that the build-blocking configuration error was resolved or that no other pages/modules were affected.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure all visible token naming on the QMY Token page reflects “QMY” (and does not show “QTM”).",
      "reason": "The QMY token page content is truncated in the diff summary, so it cannot be verified that no other visible text on the page still mentions “QTM”.",
