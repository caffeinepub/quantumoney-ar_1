REQ-5 (full Feb/2026 Terms/Privacy page content) is not evidenced in the provided diff summary. REQ-4 (footer required strings + complete sitewide removal of “Caffeine”) is only partially evidenced due to Footer truncation and lack of project-wide string evidence.",

      "reason": "Footer content is truncated in the diff, so inclusion of \"by HTgamers\" and \"helpdesk@quantumoney.net\" is not verifiable; only the \"On-chain na Internet Computer (ICP)\" phrase is explicitly visible.
