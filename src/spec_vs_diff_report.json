  "summary": "Most requested frontend pages/routes were added (Central Bank dashboard, Public Chat, Pre‑Proposals with detail view, Presale page with unlock visualization, and Gold Paper interactive visualization). Simulated wallet send + vesting logic appears implemented, but some acceptance-criteria details are not verifiable from the truncated diff. The chat feature uses polling, but the UI shown relies on a “Load Older Messages” button rather than true infinite scroll; backend anti-abuse/rate-limit enforcement is not evidenced in the shown backend diff.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Public community chat must support infinite scroll for loading older messages.",
      "reason": "The Public Chat UI shown provides a manual 'Load Older Messages' button, but no evidence of an infinite-scroll trigger (e.g., scroll listener / intersection observer) is present in the diff summary.",

      "reason": "Frontend enforces a max message length (500 chars), but the backend diff excerpt does not show any rate limiting or backend-side validation logic for message posting; only types/maps/counters are visible in the truncated backend file.",

      "reason": "Simulated vesting hook and send card include 'Simulated' labeling, but the WalletPage and VestingBreakdown changes are truncated and do not clearly evidence the required conditional display behavior and labeling for simulated balances alongside existing on-chain read-only balances.",
