  "summary": "Header “Gold Paper” nav item was changed to an internal SPA route (`/gold-paper`). The `/gold-paper` page now renders the required placeholder text and does not show any redirect logic in the provided diff. Two project metadata/summary files were also modified with unrelated content.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "The `/gold-paper` page must display ONLY the following single line of text (exactly): “Golden Paper temporarily unavailable – content preserved”. No additional UI elements are shown on `/gold-paper`.",
      "reason": "The updated page includes additional layout/styling wrappers (`div` containers and a styled `<p>`), so based strictly on the diff it is not demonstrably “ONLY the single line of text” with no other UI elements.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/GoldPaper.tsx"

      "requirement": "Remove (or leave unused) any Gold Paper button/link implementation that routes users to the documentation canister root, ensuring there is no remaining user path from the header Gold Paper entry point(s) to `https://whu4t-kiaaa-aaaah-qsc5q-cai.icp0.io/`.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the header link now points to `/gold-paper`, but it does not provide evidence that *all* other potential Gold Paper entry points or leftover external links/redirect code (outside Header.tsx) were removed or left unused.",

      "description": "Unrequested updates to repository summary/metadata files describing many unrelated features (e.g., query synchronization, monster distribution system, OpenStreetMap/Leaflet details, AR mode behavior, SEO metadata, etc.).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to changing the Gold Paper nav link and replacing the `/gold-paper` page with a placeholder. Modifying these summary/metadata files is not requested and includes descriptions unrelated to Gold Paper behavior.",
