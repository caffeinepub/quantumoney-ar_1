## Summary
**Goal:** Create a Profile page on Quantumoney.app that displays player data synchronized from QuantumoneyAR.app game canisters.

**Planned changes:**
- Add new /profile route accessible from main site navigation
- Connect to four game canisters (ippxc-5iaaa-aaaae-qgwqq-cai, x5shd-hqaaa-aaaap-qrdgq-cai, i7nyb-2yaaa-aaaaj-qowiq-cai, lkawl-3qaaa-aaaac-qdsoq-cai)
- Display player XP with real-time synchronization
- Display player coins/currency balance with real-time synchronization
- Display captured monsters collection with relevant details
- Apply dynamic background styling with transparent panels, yellow borders, and yellow text for headings
- Keep footer unmodified without Caffeine references

**User-visible outcome:** Players can view their AR game profile on Quantumoney.app, seeing their XP, coins, and captured monsters in a styled interface with yellow-themed transparent panels.
