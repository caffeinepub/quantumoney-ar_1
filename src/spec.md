# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deliver a frontend-only visual redesign and consistent global layout/spacing system so all pages feel professional, balanced, and cohesive under the fixed header—without changing content, navigation, or functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Introduce a single shared page shell/wrapper that applies a uniform top offset beneath the fixed header and establishes consistent vertical rhythm site-wide.
- Redesign visual layout (spacing, alignment, typography scale, component composition) for critical pages: Home, Login entry points (header login button + auth-required states/screens), AR page(s), Map page(s), Profile page(s), and Rules page(s), while preserving existing content and interactions.
- Standardize typography hierarchy, spacing tokens, container max-widths/padding, and common component layout rules (cards/badges/buttons/banners) across pages to remove inconsistent margins/paddings and improve readability.
- Refine the existing dark + gold direction into a cohesive “dark-luxury” theme with consistent surfaces, borders, and hover/focus/disabled states across header/footer/main content, maintaining readable contrast.

**User-visible outcome:** All pages consistently start below the fixed header with unified spacing/typography and a polished dark-luxury look; key pages (Home/Login/AR/Map/Profile/Rules) appear visually redesigned but behave exactly as before.
