# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add confirmed Gold Paper “institutional expansion” content to existing institutional website pages as content-only, strictly conceptual/non-operational additions that remain MiCA/GDPR-aligned and explicitly separate from the AR game.

**Planned changes:**
- Add new clearly labeled expansion/refinement sections (e.g., “Institutional Expansion” / “Conceptual Appendix”) to existing institutional pages without removing, renaming, or overwriting any current headings/sections or text.
- Insert conceptual, bank-style explanatory content blocks (static text plus simple markup tables/diagrams) covering: conceptual token distribution framework, locked vs unlocked balances (conceptual/non-executed), illustrative vesting & unlock timeline models (no active schedule), and theoretical treasury flow model (inbound/outbound; explicitly inactive).
- Improve structural readability of affected institutional pages using content-only layout refinements (clearer headings, chapter numbering, spacing, disclaimer callouts, and simple tables) while keeping the existing premium black/gold institutional presentation.
- Ensure all new content includes explicit non-operational language and MiCA/GDPR-aligned disclaimers, and does not add gameplay mechanics, rewards, or cross-linking to the game.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can read expanded, more structured institutional Gold Paper content (including illustrative tables/diagrams and prominent conceptual disclaimers) on the existing institutional pages, with no functional/back-end behavior changes and no linkage to the AR game.
